# Exercise of Kotlin for Compose

This repository contains a set of exercises designed to help you become proficient in Kotlin, preparing you for the subsequent lessons on Kotlin Compose.

## Prerequisites

To complete these exercises, you will need:
- A functional installation of IntelliJ (Android Studio is also acceptable)
- A working installation of Java
- (Optional) A Gradle installation

## Exercises

The exercises are divided based on the functionality/features of the language that this tutorial focuses on. While this is not a comprehensive Kotlin tutorial, it concentrates on understanding the features you'll need to work effectively with Compose.

## Kotlin 101 (base)
These exercises are designed to help you use basic Kotlin functionality that builds upon Java abstractions. 
Please follow the order in which these exercises are presented.
In particular, the exercises cover:
- Variables and constants
- Control flow
- Functions
- Collections
- Null safety

## Kotlin Classes (classes)
This section aims to make you proficient with Kotlin class-related concepts, including interfaces, open/closed classes, and generics.

## Kotlin Functional & Lambda (functional)
The goal of these exercises is to help you become comfortable with Kotlin's functional aspects, 
such as using data classes to manage structures and functions to handle state evolution.
Extension functions are a core topic here, 
demonstrating how to extend data without violating SOLID principles. 
This section also provides an overview of how lambdas can be used in the Kotlin ecosystem, 
which is particularly important as most of Compose is based on the trailing lambda paradigm.

## Kotlin Delegates (delegates)

This section serves as a bridge to understand Kotlin's general capabilities and what can be accomplished with delegates.

## Kotlin DSL (dsl)

This part introduces the potential of Kotlin for creating Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) using extension functions.
